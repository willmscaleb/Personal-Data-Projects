## Background

During my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering at McGill University, I took a Combustion course that required I learn python. Learning python led me to discover Kaggle, where I started to dabble in machine learning. It was fascinating! I have always been obsessed with sports analytics (particularly hockey and football) and I realized that I could use my newfounded data and programming skills to uncover an entire new world of possibilities in this field. As an added bonus, I would be developing highly valued data science skills that could lead to fascinating employment opportunities. So I started documenting my projects. This repository is a compilation of my most interesting work to date.

## Projects

### [NFL Expected Fantasy Points](https://github.com/willmscaleb/Personal-Data-Projects/tree/main/NFL%20Expected%20Fantasy%20Points)
The goal of this project is (currently the project is in progress) to create a metric for expected individual player fantasy points based on the opportunity that player receives in a given game. This metric should be more predictive of future fantasy points than any freely available metrics.

To achieve this goal, instead of making a single model to predict overall play by play fantasy points scored, I decomposed the problem into several sub-problems in order to more easily determine and predict patterns unique to each sub-problem. So this project has 6 models that make up the overall expected points metric. They are:
1. [Completion Probability](https://github.com/willmscaleb/Personal-Data-Projects/tree/main/NFL%20Expected%20Fantasy%20Points/Completion%20Probability%20Model)
2. Expected Yards After Catch <sup>1</sup>
3. Touchdown Probability <sup>1</sup>:
    1. Pass Attempts
    2. Rush Attempts
4. Expected Rushing Yards <sup>1</sup>
5. Fumble Lost Probabilty <sup>1</sup>
6. Interception Probability <sup>1</sup>
