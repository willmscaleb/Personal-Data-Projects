# Caleb Willms Project Portfolio

## Background

During my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering at McGill University, I took a Combustion course that required I learn python. Learning python led me to discover Kaggle, where I started to dabble in machine learning. It was fascinating! I have always been obsessed with sports analytics (particularly hockey and football) and I realized that I could use my newfounded data and programming skills to uncover an entire new world of possibilities in this field. As an added bonus, I would be developing highly valued data science skills that could lead to fascinating employment opportunities. So I started documenting my projects. This repository is a compilation of my most interesting work to date.
